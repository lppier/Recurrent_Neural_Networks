# Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow

**Basic RNN - simple_rnn.py**

Simple demonstration of RNN with only two time steps. For learning purposes. 

**Learning a waveform-like time series structure - time_series.py**

Demonstrates how a RNN can be used to learn a time-series like structure. 
Note that the RNN can produce predictions that map very closely to (a part of) the original waveform.
